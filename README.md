# EE-224: Digital Design
## Course Project
IITB-CPU is a course project under our beloved Professor Virendra Singh where we developed 16-bit very simple computer based on the Little 
Computer Architecture. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system. It has 8 general-purpose 
registers (R0 to R7). Register R7 is always stores Program Counter. PC points to the next instruction. All 
addresses are short word addresses (i.e. address 0 corresponds to the first two bytes of main memory, 
address 1 corresponds to the second two bytes of main memory, etc.). This architecture uses condition 
code register which has two flags Carry flag (c) and Zero flag (z). The IITB-CPU is very simple, but it is 
general enough to solve complex problems. The architecture allows predicated instruction execution 
and multiple load and store execution. There are three machine-code instruction formats (R, I, and J
type) and a total of 14 instructions.
